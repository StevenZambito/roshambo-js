### Summary

This project was my first experience coding a web app with JavaScript. The overall goal was to create an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game in which the user plays against the computer. I'm proud of the many JavaScript, CSS, and HTML tasks that I've completed in order to sucessfully have this game up and running. Some specifications that were implemented into the developenmt of this game involved the use of the `:hover` CSS pseudo-class and `classList.add()` to style the buttons. In addition, I also used `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` to select a random value from an array--in this case, the computer choice. This was my first time using those functions. Overall, my experience with building this app was very positive. I learned a lot about JavaScript and its ability to intertwine rather seamlessly with both HTML and CSS and in the end I was able to create what I would hope to be an engaging and cohesive user experience.
