## Assignment Overview:

For this assignment, the goal was to create a Roshambo (Rock-Paper-Scissors) game.

## Summary

This project was my first experience coding a web app with JavaScript. The overall goal was to create an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game in which the user plays against the computer. I'm proud of the many JavaScript, CSS, and HTML tasks that I've completed in order to successfully have this game up and running. Some specifications that were implemented into the development of this game involved the use of the `:hover` CSS pseudo-class and `classList.add()` to style the buttons. In addition, I also used `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` to select a random value from an array--in this case, the computer choice. This was my first time using those functions. Overall, my experience with building this app was very positive. I learned a lot about JavaScript and its ability to intertwine rather seamlessly with both HTML and CSS and in the end I was able to create what I would hope to be an engaging and cohesive user experience.

## Objectives

- Work with JavaScript and the DOM
- Practice conditional logic

### Explorer Mode

- There should be three buttons for Player One: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- There should be three buttons for Player Two: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Player One should be able to select their throw
- Player Two should be able to select their throw
- After both players make their selection, I should be told who won and the game should be over.

### Adventure Mode

- You have heard about Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you tried Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock? Modify your game to allow the extra options!
